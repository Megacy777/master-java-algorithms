## Introduction

"Master Algorithms in Java" is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing various algorithms and data structures in Java. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

### Algorithms Covered
The repository covers a wide range of algorithms, including but not limited to:

    - Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)✅
    - Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search) ✅
    - Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) ✅

    - Graph algorithms ✅
    - Network flow algorithms 
    - String algorithms (e.g., Brute Force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm)
    - Number theory
    - Lots of problem solving in 
              - Dynamic programming (e.g., Fibonacci Series, Longest Common Subsequence)
              - Greedy algorithms 
              - Computational geometry ✅

This repository provides Java implementations of the algorithms and data structures . Each algorithm and data structure is implemented as a separate Java class, making it easy to use and understand.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Java installed on your system. You can download Java from the official [Java website](https://www.java.com/).

Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Megacy777/master-java-algorithms
```


## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you can import the relevant Java classes into your project and use them as needed. Each Java class contains detailed comments explaining the purpose of the class and how to use it.

For example, to use the `BubbleSort` class to sort an array of integers, you would do the following:

```java
    int[] arr = {5, 2, 7, 1, 9};

    BubbleSort.sort(arr);
```

This would sort the array `arr` in ascending order.
